My name is Chin Jia Xiong with matrix number, WIF170029. I am
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I'll get to know more efficient way to solve a question.

I acquired A+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will try my best to learn more and ask questions frequently. Wish me luck!!!
